Scenarios
We have two scenarios that we want to cover. For every overstocked book in the warehouse, we want to give a discount. And we will accomplish this by appending the discount to the title of the book. For the second scenario, whenever an order is placed, we want to reduce the stock of the ordered book accordingly. If the stock gets below zero,we want to reject to request with a 409 area code, saying sold out.
